The scripts in this folder were not updated, are out of date and need to be fixed. 
Some hints if you feel like doing this:
- in general, the interface of the utility tools remained quite constant
- add suite (in string form) to mkC, mkI, ctrl prefix reg and other places
- digest/frag was not generally not tested for a long time, so chances are that some parts do not work inside ccn-lite
